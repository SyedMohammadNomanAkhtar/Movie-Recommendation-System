A recommender system is a system that helps users discover movies or series they may like. It is like a salesman of a company who knows what a user might like based on their watch history and preferences. It is an application of different algorithms that combine to predicts the future preference of a set of movies for a user and provides personalized suggestions.

Types of Recommender Systems:
  1. Content Based Filtering
  2. Colabrative Filtering

### I have build Content Based Recommender System

Content-based recommendation systems work more closely with item attributes rather than user data. They predict the behavior of a user based on the items they watch to.
